# Gala_Groceries-Cognizant-AI-Virtual-Experience-Program

## Introduction
Gala Groceries is a technology-led grocery store chain based in the USA, known for its commitment to providing high-quality, locally sourced produce. To maintain their reputation and optimize their supply chain, Gala Groceries approached Cognizant for assistance in addressing the challenge of managing perishable inventory effectively. The primary goal is to strike a balance between minimizing wastage due to overstocking and ensuring they never run out of essential items, thereby retaining their valued customers.

This project focuses on solving this high-level business problem by leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques. The project is divided into four main tasks:
1. **Data Exploration**: Understand the available data and formulate essential questions to address the client's supply chain challenge.
2. **Data Modeling**: Prepare and preprocess the data for analysis and model building.
3. **Model Building and Interpretation**: Develop machine learning models to predict optimal inventory levels and interpret the results.
4. **Machine Learning Production**: Implement and deploy the models for real-time inventory management.

## Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Data Exploration
- Analyze the dataset to gain insights into Gala Groceries' inventory and sales history.
- Formulate questions and hypotheses related to inventory optimization.

### Task 2: Data Modeling
- Preprocess the dataset, including handling missing data and feature engineering.
- Explore different data modeling techniques suitable for inventory forecasting.

### Task 3: Model Building and Interpretation
- Develop machine learning models for predicting optimal inventory levels.
- Interpret the model outputs to provide actionable insights.

### Task 4: Machine Learning Production
- Implement the chosen model(s) into a production environment for real-time inventory management.
- Monitor and maintain the deployed solution for continuous improvement.
